# Predictive HVAC Optimization System using IoT and ML
  This project is a prototype for an IoT-based HVAC optimization system that collects environmental data using an Arduino and sends it to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring. To improve prediction accuracy, a machine learning model was trained using a larger dataset, as the prototype's real-time data was limited.
# Key Features:
  Sensor Data Collection – Arduino reads temperature, humidity, and occupancy data and transmits it via WiFi to ThingSpeak.  
  Cloud Storage & Visualization – ThingSpeak is used to store and visualize real-time sensor data.  
  Machine Learning-Based Optimization – A predictive model was trained on an extended dataset to optimize HVAC performance.  
  Scalability – The prototype can be expanded with more sensors and integrated into a real HVAC system for automated climate control.  
  # Future Improvements:
  Direct integration with HVAC units for automated adjustments.
